# SteadyCMS

SteadyCMS â€” a flexible, block-based, static site CMS frontend for desktop and web.

## Project structure

- This repository holds the main Vue.js application which can be dropped into either the desktop (or web in the future) projects.
- The Electron-based desktop version can be found [here](https://github.com/SteadyCMS/desktop)

In the future, we plan to have a separate repository that will hold the version that runs on a web server. We're currently focused on the [desktop version](https://github.com/SteadyCMS/desktop).

## Developing the desktop version

In order to develop SteadyCMS, you need to ``git clone`` this repository source code into the SteadyCMS [desktop](https://github.com/SteadyCMS/desktop) ``source/render`` folder.
