# SteadyCMS

[![SteadyCMS](/.readme/steadycms-banner.png)](https://steadycms.github.io)

SteadyCMS â€” a flexible, block-based, static site CMS frontend for desktop.

Currently, only [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is supported but the long-term goal is to be flexible for use with any static site generator out there.

Not yet ready for production use, but we're nearing alpha state. **We're looking for early testers, adopters, and contributors to help make SteadyCMS the best it can be.**


## Roadmap

For now the Vue.js app wrapped in Electron.js for a desktop application is our primary focus, then in the future, a web version. 

- [x] Initial dashboard
- [x] Create, edit, and preview post
- [ ] **WIP** Basic block editor for editing posts (Paragraph, Heading, List, Image, Quote blocks)
- [x] Post featured image
- [ ] **WIP** Onboarding flow for creating a new website
- [ ] **WIP** Media library for managing static files
- [ ] **WIP** Publish post
- [ ] **WIP** Website settings


## Contributing

We welcome pull requests and feedback!


## Project structure

- This repository holds the main Vue.js application which can be dropped into either the desktop (or web in the future) projects.

## Developing the desktop version

### Setting up the first time

4. Run ``npm install`` to get the js dependencies for the SteadyCMS Vue.js application.
5. Run ``npm run cssdev`` to rebuild the css during development.
6. Move back to to the root folder with ``cd ../..``
7. Run ``npm install`` to get the js dependencies for the desktop version (Electron, etc).
